</div>

<p class="scene">SCENE I.—<i>A Dining Parlour.—<span class="smcap">Pickle</span> and his
sister sitting by a table, on which plates are set for
dinner—the sister working.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pickle.</span></p>

<p>Well, well, sister, a little patience and these
holidays will soon be over, the boy then goes
back to school, and all will be quiet.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Aye, till the next breaking up—no—no,
brother, unless he is severely punished for what he
has already done, depend upon it this vicious humour
will be confirmed into habit, and his follies
increase in proportion with his years.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Now would not any one think, to hear you
talk, that my son had actually some vice in him, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
my part, I own there is something so whimsical in all
his tricks, that I cannot in my heart but forgive
him, aye, and for aught I know, love him better
into the bargain.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Yes, truly, because you have never been
a sufferer by them, had you been rendered as ridiculous
as I have been by his <i>tricks</i>, as you call them,
you would have been the first to complain, and to
punish.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Nay, as to that, he has not spared even his
father—is there a day passes that I don’t break my
shins over some stumbling block he lays in my way—Why
there is not a door but is <i>armed</i> with a bason
of water on the top, and just left a-jar, so that
egad, I can’t walk over my own house without running
the risk of being wet through.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> No wonder the child’s spoilt, since you
will superintend his education yourself—you! indeed!</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Sister, sister, do not provoke me—at any
rate I have wit enough to <i>conceal my</i> ignorance, I
don’t pretend to write verses and nonsense as some
folks do.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Now would you rail at me for the disposition
I was born with—can I help it, if the gods
have made me poetical, as the divine bard says.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Made you poetical, indeed!—s’blood if you
had been born in a street near a college, aye, or even
the next door to a day-school, I might not have
been so surprised—but d——n it, madam, in the
middle of the Minories, what had you to do with
poetry and stuff?</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Provoking ignorance.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Have you not rendered yourself the sneer of
all your acquaintance, by your refined poetical intercourse
with Mr. Tagg, the author, a fellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
that stroles about the country, spouting and acting
in every barn he comes to—was he not once found
concealed in your closet, to the utter scandal of my
house, and the ruin of your reputation!</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> If you had the smallest spark of taste, you
would admire the effusions of Mr. Tagg’s pen, and
be enchanted at his admirable acting as much as
I am.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Do you tell me I can’t educate my own
child, and make a lord chancellor, or an archbishop
of Canterbury of him, which ever I like—just as I
please.</p>

<p class="right">[<i><span class="smcap">Young Pickle</span> by a string draws the chair,
<span class="smcap">Old Pickle</span> falls.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> How’s this—I’ll lay my life that is another
trick of this little mischievous wretch.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> (<i>getting up.</i>) An ungrateful little rascal,
to serve me such a trick, just as I had made an
archbishop of him—but he can’t be far off—I’ll
immediately correct him; here, Thomas.
(<i>going, meets <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> and servants bringing in covers for
dinner.</i>) But odso, here’s dinner—well, I’ll defer
my severity till that’s over—but if I don’t make him
remember this trick one while, say my name is not
Pickle. (<i>sits down to table, <span class="smcap">Pickle</span> cutting up a pheasant.</i>)
Sister, this is the first pheasant we have had
this season, it looks well—shall I help you—they
say anger makes a man dry, but mine has made me
hungry—come, here’s a wing for you, and some of
the breast.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Susan</span>, (a Cook Maid) in haste.</i></p>

<p><i>Sus.</i> Oh, dear sir—oh, dear madam—my young
master—the parrot, ma’am—oh dear!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Parrot, and your young master; what the
deuce does the girl mean?</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Mean! Why as sure as I live that vile
boy has been hurting my poor bird.</p>

<p><i>Sus.</i> Hurting, ma’am—no indeed, ma’am; I’ll
tell you the whole truth—I was not to blame, indeed
I wasn’t, ma’am, besides, I am morally certain
’twas the strange cat that kill’d it this morning.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> How! kill’d it say you;—but go on,
let us hear the whole.</p>

<p><i>Sus.</i> Why ma’am, the truth is, I did but step out
of the kitchin for a moment, when in comes my
young master, whips the pheasant that was roasting
for dinner, from the spit, and claps down your ladyship’s
parrot, picked and trussed in its place.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> The parrot!—the devil.</p>

<p><i>Sus.</i> I kept basting and basting on, and never
thought I was basting the parrot.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Oh, my sweet, my beautiful young bird,
I had just taught it to talk, too.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> You taught it to talk—it taught you to
talk, you mean, I am sure it was old enough, ’twas
hatched in the hard frost!</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Well, brother, what excuse now?—but
run, Susan, and do you hear, take John, and——</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">John</span>, slowly and lame, his face bound up.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Oh John, here’s a piece of business.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Ay, ma’am sure enow—what you have
heard, I see—business indeed—the poor thing will
never recover.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>joyfully</i>) What, John, is it a mistake of
Susan’s—is it still alive?—but—where—where is it,
John?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p><i>John.</i> Safe in stables, and it were as sound—a’
made her a hot mash, woud’nt touch it—so crippled
will never have leg to put to ground again.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> No, I’ll swear to that—for here’s one of
them. (<i>holding up a leg on a fork</i>)</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> What does the fool mean? what—what,
what is in the stable—what are you talking of?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Master’s favourite mare, Daisy, madam—poor
thing——</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> (<i>alarmed</i>) What—how—any thing the
matter with Daisy? I would not part with her
for——</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Aye, sir quite done up—won’t fetch five
pounds at the next fair.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> This dunce’s ignorance distracts me—come
along, Susan.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exeunt Miss <span class="smcap">Pickle</span> and <span class="smcap">Susan</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Why, what can it be what the devil ails
her?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Why, sir, the long and the short of the
whole affair, is as how—he’s cut me too all across
the face—mercy I did not lose my eyes.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> This cursed fellow will drive me mad—the
mare, you scoundrel, the mare.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Yes, sir, the mare—then too, my shins—master
Salve, the surgeon, says I must ’noint ’em
wi’——</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Plague on your shins—you dog—what is
the matter with the mare?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Why, sir, as I was coming home this
morning over Black Down, what does I see but
young master tearing over the turf upon Daisy, thof
your honour had forbid him to ride her—so I calls
to him to stop—but what does he do, but smacks
his whip in my face, and dash over the gate into
Stoney Lane; but what’s worse, when I rated him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
about it, he snatches up Tom Carter’s long whip,
and lays me so over the legs, and before I could
catch hold of him, he slips out of the stable, and
was off like a shot.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Well, if I forgive him this—no—I’ll send
him this moment back to school.—School! zounds,
I’ll send him to sea.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Miss <span class="smcap">Pickle</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Well, brother, yonder comes your precious
child—he’s muttering all the way up stairs to
himself, some fresh mischief, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Aye, here he comes—stand back—let us
watch him, though I can never contain my passion
long.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>they withdraw to the back of the stage.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Little Pickle</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Well, so far all goes on rarely, dinner
must be nearly ready; old Poll will taste well, I
dare say—parrot and bread sauce—ha! ha! ha!—they
suppose they are going to have a nice young
pheasant, an old parrot is a greater rarity, I’m sure—I
can’t help thinking how devilish tough the
drumsticks will be—a fine piece of work, aunt will
make when it’s found out—ecod, for aught I know,
that may be better fun than the other: no doubt
Sukey will tell, and John too, about the horse—a
parcel of sneaking fellows, always tell, tell, tell.—I
only wish I could catch them a school, once—that
is all—I’d pay them well for it I’d be bound.—Oh!
oh! here they are, and as I live, my father and
aunt—it’s all out I see—to be sure I’m not got into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
a fine scrape now, I almost wish I was safe at school
again. (<i>they come forward</i>) Oh, sir, how do you do,
sir, I was just coming to——</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Come, come, no fooling now—how dare
you look me in the face after the mischief you have
done?</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> What—what have I done?</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> You know the value I set upon that mare,
you have spoilt for ever.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> But, sir, hear me—indeed I was not so
much to blame, sir, not so very much.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Do not aggravate your faults by pretending
to excuse them—your father is too kind to you.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Dear, sir, I own I was unfortunate——I
had heard you often complain, how wild and vicious
little Daisy was, and indeed, sir, I never saw
you ride her, but I trembled least some sad accident
might befall you.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Well, and what is all this to the purpose?</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> And so, sir, I resolved, sooner than you
should suffer, to venture my own neck, and so try
to tame her for you; that was all—and so I was no
sooner mounted than off she set—I could not help
that you know, sir, and so this misfortune happened,
and so, sir—but indeed, sir——</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Could I be sure this was your motive——and
’tis purely love and regard for your old father
makes you thus teaze and torment him—perhaps I
might be inclined to——</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Yes, sir, but ’tis no love and regard to me
made him beat me so——</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> John, you know you were to blame.—Sir,
indeed the truth is, John was scolding me for it,
and when I told him as I have told you, why I did
it, and that it was to hinder you from being hurt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
he said that it was no business of mine, and that if
your neck was broke it was no such great matter.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> What—no great matter to have my neck
broke——</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> No, sir; so he said, and I was vex’d to
hear him speak so of you, and I believe I might
take up the whip, and give him a cut or two on the
legs—it could not hurt him much.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Well, child, I believe I must forgive you,
and so shall John too; aye, aye.——But I had forgot
poor Poll—what did you roast the parrot for,
you young dog?</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Why, sir, I knew you and my aunt
were both so fond of it, I thought you would like to
see it well dress’d.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Ha!—ha!—ha!——</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> But dear aunt, I know you must be
angry with me, and you think with reason.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Don’t speak to me, I am not so weak as
your father, whatever you may fancy.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> But indeed, aunt, you must hear me,
had I not loved you as I do, I should not have thus
offended you, but it was merely my regard for your
<i>character</i>.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Character!—</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit, <span class="smcap">Pickle</span> kicks him off.</i></p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> My dear aunt, I always heard that no
lady’s keep parrots or lap-dogs, ’till they can no
longer keep lovers—and when at school, I told ’em
you had a parrot, the boys all said, then you must
be a foolish old maid.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Indeed!—impudent young wretches.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Yes, aunt, and so I resolved you should
no longer be thought so—for I think you are a
great deal too young, and too handsome for an old
maid. (<i>taking her hand</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Come, sister, i’faith you must forgive him,
no female heart can withstand that.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Brother, you know I can forgive where I
see occasion; but though these faults are thus excused,
how will you answer to a charge of scandal
and ill-nature.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Ill-nature, madam—I’m sure nobody
can accuse me of that.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> How will you justify the report you
spread, of my being locked up in my closet with Mr.
Tagg, the author—can you defend so vile an attempt
to injure my reputation?</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> What, that too, I suppose, was from your
care of her character—and so to hinder your aunt
from being an old maid, you locked her up in
her closet with this author, as he is called.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Nay, indeed, dear madam, I beseech
you—’twas no such thing, all I said was, you were
amusing yourself in your closet with a favourite author.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> I amuse myself in my closet with a favourite
author! worse and worse.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Sister have patience—hear——</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> I am ashamed to see you support your boy
in such insolence—I, indeed! who am scrupulous to
a fault; but no longer will I remain subject to such
impertinence, I quit your house, sir, and you shall
quit all claim to my fortune—this moment will
I alter my will, and leave my money to a stranger,
sooner than to your family.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Her money to a stranger, leave her money
to a stranger! Oh! the three per-cent. consols—oh,
the India stock—go, child—fly, throw yourself
at your aunt’s feet—say any thing to please her—I
shall run distracted.—Oh! those <i>consols</i>——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> I am gone, sir—shall I say she may die
as soon as she pleases, but she must not give her money
to a stranger.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Aye, aye, there’s a good boy, say any thing
to please her, that will do very well—say she may
die as soon as she pleases, but she must not leave
her money to a stranger. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Little P.</span></i>) Sure
never man was so tormented—well, I thought when
my poor dear wife, Mrs. Pickle died, and left me a
disconsolate widower, I stood some chance of being
a happy man, but I know not how it is, I could
bear the vexation of my wife’s bad temper better
than this woman’s. All my married friends were as
miserable as myself—but now—faith here she comes,
and in a fine humour, no doubt.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Miss <span class="smcap">Pickle</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Brother, I have given directions for my
immediate departure, and am now come to tell you,
I will persist in my design, unless you this moment
adopt the scheme I yesterday proposed for my nephew’s
amendment.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Why, my dear sister you know there is
nothing I would not readily do to satisfy and appease
you, but to abandon my only child, to pretend
that he is not mine—to receive a beggar brat
into my arms—impossible——</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>going</i>) Very well, sir, then I am gone.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> But sister, stop—was ever man so used—how
long is this scheme of yours to last? how long
am I to be deprived of him?</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> How long! why until he is brought duly
to reflect upon his bad behaviour, which nothing
will induce him to do, so soon as thinking himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
no longer your son, but the child of poor parents—I
yesterday spoke to Margaret, his old nurse, and
she fully comprehends the whole affair.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> But why, in addition to the quitting my
own child, am I to have the torment of receiving
hers? won’t the sending him away be sufficient?</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Unless the plot is managed my way, I
will have nothing to do with it, but begone—can’t
you perceive that his distress at losing his situation,
will be augmented by seeing it possessed by another—come,
come, brother, a week’s purgatory will reform
him, depend upon it.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Why, to be sure, as you say—’twill reform
him, and as we shall have our eyes upon him all the
while, and Margaret his own nurse—</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> You may be sure she will take care of
him—well, since this is settled, the sooner ’tis done
the better—Thomas!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Send your young master.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> I see you are finally resolved, and no other
way will content you.—Well, heaven protect my
poor child.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Brother, you are so blinded by your
foolish fondness, that you cease to perceive what is
for his benefit—’tis happy for you, there is a person
to direct you, of my superior discernment.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Little Pickle</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Did you send for me, aunt?</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Child, come hither, I have a great secret<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
to disclose to you, at which you will be much
surprised.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> A secret, sir!</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Yes, and one that requires your utmost
courage to hear—you are no longer to consider that
person as your father, he is not so—Margaret, who
nursed you, has confessed, and the thing is sufficiently
proved, that you are not <i>his</i> son, but hers—she
exchanged you when an infant for my real nephew,
and her conscience has at last compelled her
to make the discovery.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> <i>I</i> another person’s child!—impossible!—ah!
you are only joking with me now, to see whether
I love you or not, but indeed (<i>to <span class="smcap">Pickle</span></i>) I
am yours—my heart tells me I am <i>only only</i> yours.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> I am afraid you deceive yourself—there
can be no doubt of the truth of Margaret’s account;
but still assure yourself of our protection—but no
longer can you remain in this house, I must not do
an injury to my own child—you belong to others—to
them you must now go.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Yet, sir, for an instant hear me—pity
me—ah too sure I know (<i>to <span class="smcap">Old Pickle</span></i>) I am <i>not</i>
your child—or would that distress which now draws
tears of <i>pity</i> from a stranger, fail to move nature in
<i>you</i>.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Comfort yourself, we must ever consider
you with compassion and regard—but now you must
begone—Margaret is waiting without to receive you.</p>

<p class="center">SCENE—<i>A Parlour.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Miss <span class="smcap">Pickle</span> and <span class="smcap">Margery</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> And so I was telling your ladyship, poor
little master does so take it to heart, and so weep
and wail, it almost makes me cry to hear him.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Well, well, since he begins already to repent,
his punishment shall be but short; have you
brought your boy with you?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Aye, have I—poor Tommy, he came from
a-board a ship but now, and is so grown, and altered—sure
enough he believes every word I have told
him, as your honour ordered me, and I warrant, is
so sheepish and shamefaced—but here comes my
master—he has heard it all already.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Pickle</span>.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">But, my lady—shall I fetch my poor Tommy to
you, he’s waiting without.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> What, that ill-looking young rascal in the
hall?—he with the jacket and trowsers.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Ay, your honour!—what, then, you have
seen him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Seen him!—ay, and felt him too.—The
booby met me bolt at the corner, run his cursed
carotty poll full in my face, and has loosened half
the teeth in my head, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Poor lad! he’s a sailor, and but aukward
as yet, and so shy I warrant—but will your honour
be kind to him.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Kind to him? Why, I am to pass for his
father—am not I?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Aye, I wish your honour had been poor
Tommy’s father—but no such luck for me, as I say
to my husband.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Indeed!—Your husband must be very much
obliged to you, and so am I.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> But do your honour see my poor Tommy,
once dressed in his fine smart clothes——</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Damme! I don’t half like that Tommy.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Yes, yes, you shall—but now go and
fetch him here to us; I should like much to see
him.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> (<i>going</i>) Do you now, madam, speak kindly
to him—for poor boy, he’s quite dash’d.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Yes, and he has dash’d some of my teeth
out—plague on him.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Now, Mr. Pickle, I insist upon your observing
a proper decorum and behaviour towards this
poor lad; observe the condescension of my deportment—methinks
I feel a strange inclination already
in his favour, perhaps I may advance him bye and
bye, to be my page—shall I brother?—Oh, here he
comes—and I declare, as prepossessing a countenance
as ever I beheld.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Margery</span> and <span class="smcap">Little Pickle</span> as a sailor boy.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Come hither child, was ever there such an engaging
air?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Go Tommy, do as you are bid, there’s a
good boy—thank his honour for his goodness to you.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Be you the old fellow that’s just come
to be my father?</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> (<i>aside</i>) Old fellow! he’s devilish dashed to
be sure—yes, I am the old fellow, as you call it—will
you be a good boy?</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Ay, but what will you gi’ me?—must I
be good for nothing?</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> (<i>mimicking</i>) Good for nothing! nay, that
I’ll swear you are already. Well, and how long
have you been come from sea? eh, how do you like
a sailor’s life?</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> So this is the way I am to be entertained in
future, with forecastle jokes, and tarpauling songs.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Brother, do not speak so harshly to the
poor lad, he’s among strangers, and wants encouragement—come
to me, my pretty boy, I’ll be your
friend——</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Friend! oh, what, you’re my grandmother—father,
must not I call her granne?</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> What, he wants encouragement, sister—yes,
poor soul, he’s among strangers—he’s found
out one relation, however, sister—this boy’s assurance
diverts me—I like him (<i>aside</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Granne’s mortish cross and frumpish—la
father, what makes your mother, there, look so
plaguy foul-weather’d.</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Mother, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Oh, nothing at all, my dear, she’s the best
humoured person in the world—go throw yourself at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
her feet, and ask her for her blessing—perhaps she
may gi’ you something.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> A blessing! I sha’n’t be much richer for
that neither—perhaps she may give me half a crown;
I’ll throw myself at her feet, and ask her for a
guinea—(<i>kneels</i>)—Dear granne, give me your picture
(<i>catches hold of it</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> Stand off, wretch, am I to be robbed, as
well as insulted?</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> Fie, child, learn to behave yourself better.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Behave myself—learn <i>you</i> to behave
yourself, I should not have thought of <i>you</i> indeed—get
you gone—what do you here? (<i>beats her out.</i>)</p>

<p class="right">[<i>and Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> Well, sister, this plan of yours succeeds I
hope to your satisfaction—he’ll make a mighty
pretty page, sister—what an engaging air, he has
sister; this is some revenge for her treatment of my
poor boy (<i>aside</i>).</p>

<p><i>Miss P.</i> I perceive this to be all a contrivance,
and the boy is taught to insult me thus—you may
repent of this unparalleled treatment of unprotected
innocence.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Pick.</i> What, she means her lover, the player-man,
I suppose, but I’ll watch her, and her consols too;
and if I catch him again in my house, it shall be his
last appearance this season; I can tell him that, and
the next part he plays, shall be Captain Macheath
in the prison scene, egad.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Little Pickle</span>, alone.</i></p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> There they go, ha! ha! ha! my scheme
has gone on rarely, rather better than theirs, I think.—Blessing
on the old nurse for consenting to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
it—I’ll teach ’em to turn people out of doors—let me see,
what trick shall I play ’em now—suppose I set the
house on fire—no—no—’tis too soon for that as yet—that
will do very well bye and bye—let me consider—I
wish I could see my sister, I’ll discover myself
to her, and then we might contrive something together
nicely—that staircase leads to her room, I’ll try
and call her (<i>goes to the door and listens</i>) there’s nobody
in the way!—Hist! hist!—Maria—Maria—she

No, there’s nobody here—heigho—I’ve almost

shall always call him, ay, and love him too—(<i>going</i>).</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> (<i>running forward</i>) Maria!—sister!—stop
an instant.</p>

<p><i>Maria.</i> My brother!—Charles—impossible.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> ’Tis e’en so, and faith ’twas all a trick
about the nurse and child; I coax’d the old woman
to confess the whole to me—you can’t contrive to
kill yourself for the loss of me, can you?—that
would have a fine effect—is there nothing I can
think of?—Suppose you pretend to fall in love with
me, and we run away together.—</p>

<p><i>Maria.</i> That will do admirably—depend upon my
playing my part with a good will, for I owe some revenge
for their treatment of you, besides, you know
I can refuse you nothing.</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> You will not be so hard hearted, sure—we
will not part—here is my anchor fixed—here

<p><i>Maria.</i> (<i>romantically</i>) No—we’ll never part—Oh,

<p><i>Old P.</i> He’s infected her with his assurance
already.—What, you young minx, do you own you
love him?</p>

<p><i>Maria.</i> Love him! Sir, I adore him, and in spite
of your utmost opposition, ever, ever shall.</p>

<p><i>Old P.</i> Oh, ruined! undone—what a wretched
old man I am—but, Maria, child—</p>

<p><i>Maria.</i> Think not to dissuade me, sir—vain attempt—no,

<p><i>Old P.</i> Oh dear, what shall I do? what will become

my daughter, and for ought I know, my son too—why
child, he’s a poor beggar, he’s not worth a sixpence.</p>

home now without delay. (<i>reads</i>) “Honoured sir,
I heartily repent of having so far abused your goodness,
whilst I was blest with your protection, but as
I fear no penitence will ever restore me to your favour,
I have resolved to put it out of my power
again to offend you, by instantly bidding adieu to
my country for ever.” Here, John, run, go directly
to Margery’s and fetch home my son, and——</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> (<i>interrupting him</i>) You may save yourself
the trouble, ’tis too late, you’ll never bring him too
now, make as many signals, or fire as many guns as
you please.</p>

<p><i>Old P.</i> What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Mean, why he and I have changed
births you know.</p>

<p><i>Old P.</i> Changed births!</p>

<p><i>Little P.</i> Ay, I’m got into his hammock, and he’s
got into mine, that’s all; he’s some leagues off at
sea, by this time, for the tide serves, and the wind
is fair; Botany Bay’s the word, my boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p><i>Old P.</i> Botany Bay! well, I’ll instantly see if ’tis
true, why, I’ll come back, just to blow your brains
out, and lo be either hang’d or sent to Botany Bay
after him.</p>
